### Connecting Adoptable Pets to their Forever Homes

Pawprints is an iOS app that connects interested users to adoptable pets in their area. Users are able to filter search results to find available pets based on species, breed, age, gender, and distance. They are also able to save potential pets into their Favorites list and submit applications through the app when they are ready. This landing page is designed to highlight features available in the app for interested users.
